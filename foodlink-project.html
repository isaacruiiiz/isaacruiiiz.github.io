                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>How might we connect food waste with hunger relief? Developed as an academic project, FoodLink is a
                    dual-sided platform serving two key users: Restaurants with surplus food and Volunteer Riders. <br>
                    Restaurants publish available food packs in real-time, while volunteers use an interactive map to
                    locate both the food and the recipients. The standout feature allows the community to pin the
                    locations of homeless individuals, creating a live, crowdsourced database to guide deliveries
                    effectively.</p>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p><b>The Disconnect: </b>While local restaurants often face the challenge of managing surplus food,
                    homeless individuals struggle to access daily meals due to mobility issues or lack of
                    information.<br><br> <b>The Gap:</b> There is currently no streamlined, real-time channel that
                    connects this surplus with the volunteers willing to deliver it. Furthermore, the transient nature
                    of homelessness makes it difficult for volunteers to know exactly where to deliver aid efficiently.

                <h2>User Research</h2>

                <p><b>01. Defining the Dual Experience (Personas)</b><br>
                    Since FoodLink operates as a two-sided marketplace, we began the project by developing distinct
                    personas to address the unique motivations and pain points of our two primary user groups:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The "Solidarity Rider" (Volunteer): Driven by altruism but limited by time. Their primary need
                        was an intuitive map interface to locate recipients quickly without friction.</li>
                    <li>The "Partner Restaurant" (Donor): Focused on operational efficiency. They needed a seamless flow
                        to publish surplus food packs in seconds during busy service hours.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <p><b>02. Cross-Functional Usability Testing</b><br>
                    To validate our assumptions, we conducted a comprehensive peer-review session involving students
                    from both Web Development (DAW) and Marketing courses.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Methodology: We utilized a "round-robin" testing strategy where groups exchanged prototypes to
                        perform core tasks (e.g., "Publish a pack" or "Locate a recipient").</li>
                    <li>The Value: While development peers focused on functionality and bugs, the marketing students
                        provided a critical layer of feedback regarding desirability and brand perception, simulating a
                        real-world stakeholder environment.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <p><b>03. The Key Iteration: Emotional Design</b><br>
                    The most impactful insight came from the marketing cohort. Feedback indicated that while the app was
                    functional, the UI felt too "transactional" and cold for a platform based on charity and human
                    connection.</p>

                <p><b>The Solution: </b>We iterated on the UI to introduce Emotional Design elements. We created a
                    friendly brand mascot to guide users through the experience. This wasn't just an aesthetic choice;
                    the mascot served to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Humanize the interface: Making the act of helping feel warmer and more rewarding.</li>
                    <li>Reduce cognitive load: Acting as a visual guide during the onboarding and delivery confirmation
                        steps.</li>
                </ol>
